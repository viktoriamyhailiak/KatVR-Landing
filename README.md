This project is a stylish and responsive landing page built using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. It features a clean, modern layout that combines Flexbox and CSS Grid for structured and adaptive design, ensuring content is well-positioned across different screen sizes. I implemented two Swiper.js sliders to create engaging, swipeable sections that enhance the user experience. The interface includes subtle yet smooth animations, such as element scaling on hover, adding an interactive feel to the page.

A standout component is the custom order section, which includes a two-step form for gathering user and order details. The layout is designed for clarity and ease of use, with a variety of slide-out menus that simplify navigation throughout the site. Altogether, this landing page offers not only aesthetic appeal but also intuitive functionality, making it user-friendly and visually engaging.
